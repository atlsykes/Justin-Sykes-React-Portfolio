                  I have 2 grown children, Matthew & Nathan with my lovely wife
                  Silvia, and we currently reside in Mechanicsville, VA. We've
                  just relocated after 25 years in Atlanta, GA and am settling
                  in nicely to this suburb of Richmond. This unincorporated
                  community with a population of ~37,000 is proving to be one of
                  the nicest rural localities, along with close proximity to
                  family, makes this is an idyllic location.
