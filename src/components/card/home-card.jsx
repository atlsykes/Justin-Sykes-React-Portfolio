                  I have 2 grown children, Matthew & Nathan with my lovely wife
                  Silvia, and we currently live in Marietta, GA. We've been
                  living in Georgia for over 23 years and have grown very
                  accustomed to the "southern lifestyle with a somewhat
                  metropolitan feel" in Atlanta. With all the green space,
                  southern hospitality, access to extensive outdoor activities
                  year round, lower cost of living, northern GA feels like
                  paradise to us.
