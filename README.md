1. Access main branch at my github repo and clone to your local folder to install app: https://github.com/204039643/Justin-Sykes-React-Portfolio
2. Navigate to app. folder on local and run 'NPM INSTALL' in the CLI.

4. Switch to 'master' branch for github pages.
5. Link and push newly cloned project to GitHub by running the following commands in the CLI:
